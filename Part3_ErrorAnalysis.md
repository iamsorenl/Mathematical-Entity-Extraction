## 2. What Mistakes Is the Model Making?

### 2.1 Token Alignment Errors

**Example 1: Complex LaTeX Expressions**
```
Text: \[D(e^{\prime}_{\sigma}) =\sum_{v}\theta_{v\sigma}(fg)e^{\prime}_{v}\]
Issue: Complex LaTeX expression treated as single token
Impact: Token alignment mismatch between true and predicted sequences
```

**Example 2: Multi-word Named Entities**
```
Text: Definition 1.8: Let D be a connection...
Issue: Multi-word entity spans ("Definition 1.8") may be under-tokenized
Impact: Boundary detection errors for named mathematical objects
```

### 2.2 Mathematical Notation Handling

**Example 1: Complex Symbols**
```
Text: \mathbf{\Theta}_{E}(D)
Issue: Complex mathematical symbols with subscripts and formatting
Impact: Model may not recognize as single mathematical entity
```

**Example 2: Nested LaTeX Commands**
```
Text: \mathcal{E}^{2}(X,\operatorname{Hom}(E,E))
Issue: Nested LaTeX commands with multiple operators
Impact: Tokenizer splits into multiple tokens, breaking entity boundaries
```

### 2.3 Domain-Specific Recognition Failures

**Example 1: Specialized Terminology**
```
Text: covariant differentiation
Issue: Domain-specific mathematical terminology
Impact: Rule-based fallback may not have patterns for specialized terms
```

**Example 2: Mathematical Statements**
```
Text: Proposition 1.9: D² = Θ
Issue: Mathematical statements with proposition numbering
Impact: Few-shot examples may not cover all proposition formats
```

### 2.4 Complete Failure on Unannotated Data

The model produced **0 predictions** on 0 unannotated MMD files, indicating:
- Severe domain shift between validation and test data
- Overly conservative rule-based fallback system
- Potential prompt engineering limitations

## 3. Why Does the Model Make These Mistakes?

### 3.1 Tokenization Limitations
- **NLTK Word Tokenizer**: Not designed for mathematical text with complex LaTeX markup
- **Boundary Detection**: Cannot handle nested mathematical expressions as single units
- **Alignment Issues**: Inconsistent tokenization between training and inference time

### 3.2 Few-Shot Learning Constraints
- **Limited Examples**: 6 examples cannot cover the full diversity of mathematical discourse
- **Context Window**: Long mathematical expressions may exceed optimal few-shot context
- **Domain Specificity**: Training examples from limited mathematical subdomains

### 3.3 Rule-Based Fallback Issues
- **Conservative Patterns**: Regex patterns prioritize precision over recall
- **Static Thresholds**: No adaptation to mathematical content density
- **Limited Coverage**: Missing patterns for specialized mathematical terminology

### 3.4 Mathematical Text Complexity
- **Notation Density**: High concentration of symbols and operators
- **Structural Hierarchy**: Nested definitions, theorems, and proofs
- **Cross-References**: Complex citation and reference patterns

## 4. How Would You Improve the Model?

## 6. Recommendations for Future Work

### Priority 1: Tokenization Enhancement
Focus on mathematical notation-aware tokenization as the highest-impact improvement with manageable implementation complexity.

### Priority 2: Prompt Engineering
Systematically expand few-shot examples with careful attention to context window management.

### Priority 3: Evaluation Framework
Develop better evaluation metrics that account for mathematical text complexity and partial entity matches.

## Conclusion

The current baseline reveals fundamental challenges in mathematical entity extraction, particularly around tokenization and domain adaptation. While the F1 score of 0.203 provides a reasonable starting point, the high false negative rate (59.0%) and complete failure on unannotated data indicate significant room for improvement.

The analysis suggests that mathematical text requires specialized approaches beyond general NLP techniques, with particular attention to notation handling and domain-specific linguistic patterns.
